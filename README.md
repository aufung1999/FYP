This repository reconstructs the results based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04363.pdf)

We are going to create a Convolution Neural network to distinguish between different "sounds". 

The Sounds we are going to distinguish are a part of the [UrbanSound8K](https://serv.cusp.nyu.edu/projects/urbansounddataset/download-urbansound8k.html) dataset. This consists of over 8,000 sounds of 10 categories:
- Children playing
- Dog Barking
- Jackhammer
- Running Engine
- Air conditioner
- Street music
- Gun shots
- Siren
- Drilling
- Car Horn

Everything is in the jupyter notebook.

Here is my [video]() that explains everything going on.
